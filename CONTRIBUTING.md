## Reporting an issue

If you have found a bug please feel free to report an issue after ensuring that no such bug has been reported yet (check [existing issues](https://github.com/Amphiluke/handy-scroll/issues) first). Be sure to write a clear description of the problem. It will be great if you also provide a minimum example revealing the bug. You may use such services as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) and [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) to assemble a live demo for the issue youâ€™ve found.

## Making changes in code and opening a pull request

If you know the way to fix some bug or just to make the widget better, you are welcome to open a pull request. Please provide a clear and detailed description of what do your changes fix or improve, or refer an existing issue containing such an explanation.

Before submitting a new pull request be sure to do the following things.

* Ensure that your changes do not break existing features.
* Test your changes in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge.
* Before committing your changes please make sure that the plugin sources pass ESLint checks. Just use the command `npm run lint` in the project directory (of course, you need to install the project first by executing `npm install`). Fix any problems reported by ESLint before submitting a pull request.
* Do not forget to update the minified version of the plugin sources. Use the command `npm run build` for that.

Thanks for your contribution! :tea:
